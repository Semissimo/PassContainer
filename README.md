This project is about a password manager. 
It was created to solve a big issue of mine, which is remembering passwords. With this project, I decided to put together a database that will contain the names of websites and their corresponding passwords. 
Then, I thought of programming it as if there were multiple users who want to access it, so I added another database to store the users. Then, I linked the two databases so that each user would have their saved passwords.
